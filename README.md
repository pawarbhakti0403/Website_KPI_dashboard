# Website_KPI_dashboard
This dashboard is built on the Microsoft Excel. It is the simplest dashboard but very useful which consists of website KPI's and comparison of KPI's for this week and last week.
I have used important Excel features for building this dashboard and some of them are -
1. Data Validation
2. Conditional formatting
3. Sparkline charts
4. Match function
5. Index function

Some of the insights from Website KPI dashboard are -
1. The number of people who visits the site is increased by 3% in this week.
2. 19% Views have been increased in this week.
3. There is an increase in social engagement of about 25% whereas no as such huge increment in social followers.
4. 8% of decrease is observed in social media visit% and added to cart feature.
5. Only 4% of transactions are incresed in this week.
6. A  great amount of increment is observed in revenue and conversion% that is >30%.
7. At the same time, 23% decreased in repeat order % in this week.
8. If we observed Trendlines of each KPI, there is approximately constant increase for social followers. It is the only KPI which has not decreased most of the time.
